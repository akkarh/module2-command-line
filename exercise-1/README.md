# Exercise 1
This exercise is a brief review of terminal commands. Like all exercises, you can see the answers in the `complete` branch.

Open up your command-line terminal, and perform the following tasks (no need to fork or download this repository):

```bash
# Navigate to your "Documents" folder


# Create a new folder called "quick-exercise"


# Navigate into that folder


# Using the text-edit of your choice (e.g., Atom), create a new (empty) file
# called "constitution.txt" inside the "quick-exercise" folder you made


# List the contents of the folder to verify the new file is there


# Search online for the text of the US Constitution (while it's still around!)
# and paste it into the "constitution.txt" file you created. Save your changes in
# the editor.


# Display the contents of the in the terminal
# Hint: use the `less` command so you can easily scroll up and down.


# Navigate to the "Desktop" folder for your machine


# Display the contents of the "Documents/quick-exercise/constitution.txt" file in the Terminal
# *without changing directories again!*



# Bonus: Create 10 files with one single command in your terminal. Then delete them all!


```
